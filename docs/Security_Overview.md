# Security Overview for Global Connect

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of the Global Connect application, especially given its reliance on the Stellar network for financial transactions. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user data, ensure transaction integrity, and maintain overall system security.

## Key Security Measures

1. **Data Encryption**
   - **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using TLS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Sensitive information, such as user passwords and private keys, is encrypted before being stored in the database.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **User  Authentication**: Users are required to authenticate using secure methods, such as email verification and strong password policies.
   - **Token-Based Authentication**: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to certain features and data is restricted based on user roles, ensuring that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated on both the client and server sides to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
   - **Output Encoding**: Data rendered in the user interface is properly encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

4. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - **Code Reviews**: Regular code reviews are conducted to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
   - **Dependency Management**: The application uses tools to monitor and update dependencies, ensuring that known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries are addressed promptly.

5. **Transaction Security**
   - **Multi-Signature Transactions**: For high-value transactions, multi-signature requirements can be implemented to enhance security.
   - **Transaction Monitoring**: The application monitors transactions for unusual patterns or behaviors that may indicate fraud or unauthorized access.

6. **Regular Security Audits**
   - **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration tests are conducted to identify vulnerabilities and assess the security posture of the application.
   - **Security Audits**: Periodic security audits are performed to ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.

7. **User  Education**
   - **Security Awareness**: Users are provided with information on best practices for securing their accounts, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) when available.

## Conclusion

The Global Connect application employs a comprehensive set of security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of transactions. By adhering to best practices in security and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities, we aim to provide a safe and secure environment for our users.
