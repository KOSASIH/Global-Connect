# System Architecture Diagram for Global Connect

## Overview

The architecture of the Global Connect application is designed to facilitate seamless transactions on the Stellar network while providing a user-friendly interface. This document outlines the key components of the system and their interactions.

## Architecture Components

1. **Client-Side (Frontend)**
   - **React Application**: The user interface built with React, allowing users to interact with the application.
   - **State Management**: Utilizes Redux or Context API for managing application state.
   - **API Calls**: Communicates with the backend server to perform operations such as creating assets, issuing PiCoins, and transferring funds.

2. **Backend Server**
   - **Node.js/Express**: The server-side application that handles API requests from the frontend.
   - **Stellar SDK**: Integrates with the Stellar network to perform blockchain operations such as asset creation, transactions, and balance checks.
   - **Database**: (Optional) A database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user data, transaction history, and application settings.

3. **Stellar Network**
   - **Public Stellar Network**: The decentralized blockchain network that facilitates transactions and asset management.
   - **Horizon API**: The API server that provides access to the Stellar network, allowing the application to submit transactions and query account information.

4. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - **Data Visualization**: Provides insights into transaction trends, user activity, and other metrics.
   - **Reporting Tools**: Generates reports based on user transactions and balances.
