# Pi Auto Connector

**Ultra High-Tech, AI-Driven Pi Network Integration for Global-Connect**

---

## üöÄ Overview

The `pi_auto_connector` is an advanced, AI-powered module that auto-discovers, connects, monitors, and self-heals all Pi Network nodes‚Äîseamlessly integrating the Pi ecosystem with the Global-Connect platform. Leveraging AI for orchestration, troubleshooting, and optimization, this connector is designed to be unstoppable, resilient, and extensible for any scale.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Orchestrated Node Discovery:**  
  Dynamic strategies for discovering new Pi Network nodes, optimized by OpenAI GPT-4o.

- **Automated Secure Connections:**  
  AI-generated connection parameters for reliability and security.

- **Self-Healing & Troubleshooting:**  
  Automatic recovery and fix suggestions using LLM-based analysis.

- **Async, High-Performance:**  
  Handles massive numbers of nodes in parallel with asyncio and httpx.

- **Observability & Extensibility:**  
  Event hooks and logging for analytics, and easy extension for new Pi API endpoints or AI models.

## ‚ö° Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd apps/ai/pi_auto_connector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Set Environment Variable

```bash
export PI_API_BASE="https://your-pi-network-api"
export PI_API_KEY="your-pi-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

### 3. Run Connector

```python
import asyncio
from connector import PiAutoConnector

connector = PiAutoConnector(
    pi_api_base="https://your-pi-network-api",
    pi_api_key="your-pi-api-key",
    openai_api_key="your-openai-api-key"
)
asyncio.run(connector.run())
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can configure the Pi Auto Connector using environment variables and/or by passing parameters directly to the `PiAutoConnector` class.

### Environment Variables

| Variable Name        | Description                                    | Example Value                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `PI_API_BASE`        | Base URL for your Pi Network API provider      | `https://api.minepi.com`                |
| `PI_API_KEY`         | Access token for the Pi API                    | `your-pi-api-key`                       |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | API key for OpenAI (GPT-4/4o or compatible)    | `your-openai-api-key`                   |

Set them in your shell using:

```bash
export PI_API_BASE="https://your-pi-network-api"
export PI_API_KEY="your-pi-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

## üß† Extending the Connector

The Pi Auto Connector is designed to be easily extended and customized for advanced integration scenarios or new requirements.

### Add New AI Capabilities

- **Custom AI Models or Prompts:**  
  Modify or extend prompts in `ai_agent.py` to use different models (OpenAI, open-source LLMs) or to adapt to new orchestration and troubleshooting strategies.

- **Advanced AI Workflows:**-documented, making it simple to integrate new logic or connect to external systems!

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

- Never commit or expose your API keys.
- Always use HTTPS endpoints for both Pi API and OpenAI.
- Validate all AI-generated connection parameters before using them in production.
- Review and restrict network/firewall settings as appropriate for your deployment.
